<h3>Harry Potter film series</h3>

The Harry Potter film series is famous all over the world and is loved by children, teenagers and adults. It's based on the books by JK Rowling. <br />
The films are imaginative, funny, frightening and, of course, magical! What makes them so successful is that they combine action, fantasy and friendship.<br />

If you like adventure and magic, you'll love the Harry Potter films!

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
"The Shawshank Redemption" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time since its release in 1994. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this film is a testament to the power of storytelling and the indomitable human spirit.<br />
Set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the life of Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murder. As the story unfolds, we witness Andy's resilience and unwavering hope, which not only transforms his own life but touches the hearts of those around him.<br />


<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>
A rare gem of casting and direction
</p>

<p>
Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at "the mile" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls.<br />
All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the time.
